  <h3>Corona viruses are a wide range of viruses that may cause disease in animals and humans. It is known that a number of coronaviruses cause human respiratory diseases in severity ranging from common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The newly discovered Coronavirus causes Covid-19 disease.
Covid-19 trauma is an infectious disease caused by the last detected virus from the Coronaviruses. There was no knowledge of the existence and disease of this new virus before its outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Covid-19 has now become a pandemic to many countries in the world.
The most common symptoms of Covid-19 disease are fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Other, less common symptoms that some patients may have include: pain and aches, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell, a rash or discoloration of the fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected without feeling very mild symptoms.
Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without the need for special treatment. But the symptoms are more severe for about one out of every five people with Covid-19 disease who suffers from difficulty breathing. The risk of developing severe complications increases among the elderly and people with other health problems such as high blood pressure, heart and lung disease, diabetes or cancer. All persons, of any age, should seek medical attention immediately if they develop a fever and / or cough accompanied by difficulty breathing / shortness of breath, pain or chest pressure, or loss of speech or movement. Whenever possible, it is recommended that you contact your physician or health care facility in advance, so that the patient can be directed to the appropriate clinic.
